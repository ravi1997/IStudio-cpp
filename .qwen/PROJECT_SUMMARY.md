# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Create a comprehensive QWEN.md file that serves as instructional context for future interactions with the IStudio project, a conceptual compiler for the Impossible Programming Language (IPL) designed to experiment with next-generation C++ compilation concepts.

## Key Knowledge
- **Project Type**: C++23 project with CMake build system for an experimental IPL compiler
- **Technology Stack**: C++23, CMake 3.28.3+, supports GCC 14+ or Clang 16+
- **Architecture**: Modular design with lexer, parser, AST, semantic analyzer, and IR components
- **Main Components**: Two executables (`IStudio` and `ipl_compiler`) with configurable grammar/translation rules
- **Build Commands**: 
  - `cmake .. && make` for basic build
  - `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release .. && make` for release builds
- **Testing**: Uses CTest framework with comprehensive test suite including functionality, lexing, compilation, and expected failure tests
- **IPL Language Features**: Modules, imports, typed functions, variables with type annotations, control flow statements
- **File Structure**: 
  - `src/ipl_compiler/`, `src/istudio/`, `src/semantic/`, `src/ir/` for source code
  - `examples/ipl/` contains IPL example files (.ipl extension)
  - `examples/grammar_rules.txt` defines the language grammar
- **Installation**: Supports system-wide installation with CMake install targets

## Recent Actions
- Completed comprehensive analysis of the IStudio project structure
- Examined key files including README.md, CMakeLists.txt, main.cpp, and example IPL files
- Identified the project as a C++23-based compiler for the experimental IPL language
- Analyzed the build system, test suite, and project architecture
- Successfully generated a comprehensive QWEN.md file at `/home/ravi/workspace/IStudio/QWEN.md`
- Documented all project components, build instructions, testing procedures, and development conventions

## Current Plan
- [DONE] Analyze project structure and identify key components
- [DONE] Examine configuration files (CMakeLists.txt, README.md) 
- [DONE] Review source code organization and main.cpp entry point
- [DONE] Investigate examples and grammar rules
- [DONE] Generate comprehensive QWEN.md file with all project details
- [DONE] Verify completion and proper documentation of all project aspects
