## Key Improvements

1. **Memory Safety**: Rust-style ownership and borrowing system to prevent memory-related bugs
2. **Null Safety**: Flow-sensitive null checking to prevent null pointer exceptions
3. **Generic Programming**: C++-style templates with concept constraints
4. **Meta-Programming**: Python-style decorators and meta-classes
5. **Mathematical Operations**: MATLAB-style matrix and vector operations
6. **Error Handling**: Multiple approaches (exceptions, Result<T, E>, Optional<T>)
7. **Functional Programming**: Higher-order functions, pattern matching, immutability
8. **OOP Enhancements**: Multiple inheritance via interfaces, traits, contracts

## Backward Compatibility

All existing IPL features remain intact. The new features are additive, maintaining backward compatibility with existing code while providing enhanced expressiveness and safety.
